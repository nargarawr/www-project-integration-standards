description: Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login, and
  password change are checked against a set of breached passwords either locally (such
  as the top 1,000 or 10,000 most common passwords which match the system's password
  policy) or using an external API. If using an API a zero knowledge proof or other
  mechanism should be used to ensure that the plain text password is not sent or used
  in verifying the breach status of the password. If the password is breached, the
  application must require the user to set a new non-breached password. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab=Formal_Numbering))
