description: Verify that symmetric keys, passwords, or API secrets generated by or
  shared with clients are used only in protecting low risk secrets, such as encrypting
  local storage, or temporary ephemeral uses such as parameter obfuscation. Sharing
  secrets with clients is clear-text equivalent and architecturally should be treated
  as such.
