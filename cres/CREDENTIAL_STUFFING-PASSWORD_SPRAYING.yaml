    description: Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login,
      and password change are checked against a set of breached passwords either locally
      (such as the top 1,000 or 10,000 most common passwords which match the system's
      password policy) or using an external API. If using an API a zero knowledge
      proof or other mechanism should be used to ensure that the plain text password
      is not sent or used in verifying the breach status of the password. If the password
      is breached, the application must require the user to set a new non-breached
      password. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab=Formal_Numbering))

    description: Verify that anti-automation controls are effective at mitigating
      breached credential testing, brute force, and account lockout attacks. Such
      controls include blocking the most common breached passwords, soft lockouts,
      rate limiting, CAPTCHA, ever increasing delays between attempts, IP address
      restrictions, or risk-based restrictions such as location, first login on a
      device, recent attempts to unlock the account, or similar. Verify that no more
      than 100 failed attempts per hour is possible on a single account.
