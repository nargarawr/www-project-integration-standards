description: Verify that the use of weak authenticators (such as SMS and email) is
  limited to secondary verification and transaction approval and not as a replacement
  for more secure authentication methods. Verify that stronger methods are offered
  before weak methods, users are aware of the risks, or that proper measures are in
  place to limit the risks of account compromise.
