    description: Verify that symmetric keys, passwords, or API secrets generated by
      or shared with clients are used only in protecting low risk secrets, such as
      encrypting local storage, or temporary ephemeral uses such as parameter obfuscation.
      Sharing secrets with clients is clear-text equivalent and architecturally should
      be treated as such.

    description: Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login,
      and password change are checked against a set of breached passwords either locally
      (such as the top 1,000 or 10,000 most common passwords which match the system's
      password policy) or using an external API. If using an API a zero knowledge
      proof or other mechanism should be used to ensure that the plain text password
      is not sent or used in verifying the breach status of the password. If the password
      is breached, the application must require the user to set a new non-breached
      password. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab=Formal_Numbering))
