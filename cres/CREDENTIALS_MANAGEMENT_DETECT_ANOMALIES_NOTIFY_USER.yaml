description: Verify that secure notifications are sent to users after updates to authentication
  details, such as credential resets, email or address changes, logging in from unknown
  or risky locations. The use of push notifications - rather than SMS or email - is
  preferred, but in the absence of push notifications, SMS or email is acceptable
  as long as no sensitive information is disclosed in the notification.
