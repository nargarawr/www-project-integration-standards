description: Verify that passwords are stored in a form that is resistant to offline
  attacks. Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed using an approved one-way key derivation
  or password hashing function. Key derivation and password hashing functions take
  a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs when generating a password hash.
