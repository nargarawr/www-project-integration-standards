    description: Verify that the use of weak authenticators (such as SMS and email)
      is limited to secondary verification and transaction approval and not as a replacement
      for more secure authentication methods. Verify that stronger methods are offered
      before weak methods, users are aware of the risks, or that proper measures are
      in place to limit the risks of account compromise.
