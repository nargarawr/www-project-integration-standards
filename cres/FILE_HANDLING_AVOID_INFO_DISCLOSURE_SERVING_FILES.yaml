description: Verify that the web tier is configured to serve only files with specific
  file extensions to prevent unintentional information and source code leakage. For
  example, backup files (e.g. .bak), temporary working files (e.g. .swp), compressed
  files (.zip, .tar.gz, etc) and other extensions commonly used by editors should
  be blocked unless required.
